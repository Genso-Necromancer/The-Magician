=Magic Absorber
Readded the check that ties it to the spellcard system to rank 5, forgot to do this after testing it last time!
No longer provides ANY damage received buff!
Damage absorption mechanic increased from 5-10% DMG stolen to 20-25% DMG stolen, and it's duration changed to 1 round for Magician's DMG buff and "2 rounds" for the attacker's DMG debuff
The DMG debuff will always succeed vs the target, but if the riposte misses, both the buff and debuff fail to occur
Grants 1 Aegis again, like all spellcards do
Used a trick that seperates the De/buff applied by this skill from other DMG de/buffs, this is to keep the duration clear and readable in combat when they're applied
