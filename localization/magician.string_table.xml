This made all the more complete by her imposing hat. Mundane in nature, one can't help but feel a sort of magic when witnessing it.]]></entry>

Should things not go as planned, The Magician brings both her talents in more earthly witchcraft to bolster or patch up her companions, or her faithful broom to sweep the opposition back into place.]]></entry>
